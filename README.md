**DRIVER ANTI SLEEP DEVICE** 

Feeling sleepy while driving could cause hazardous traffic accident. However, whendriving alone on highway or driving over a long period of time, drivers are inclined to bored and feel sleepy, or even fall asleep. Nowadays most of the products of driver anti-sleep detection sold in the market is simply earphone making intermittent noises,which is quite annoying and inefficient. As such, there is a high demand for cheap and efficient driver sleep detection. Therefore, we came up with an idea to develop a driver anti-sleep alarm system, which could effectively meet this demand.

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect the sleepiness of the driver and make alarms accordingly. There will be a Kinect camera that constantly
takes image of driver, a beagle board that implement image processing algorithm, and a feedback circuit that could generate alarm and a power supply system.
