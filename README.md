**DRIVER ANTI SLEEP DEVICE** 

Feeling sleepy while driving could cause hazardous traffic accident. However, whendriving alone on highway or driving over a long period of time, drivers are inclined to bored and feel sleepy, or even fall asleep. Nowadays most of the products of driver anti-sleep detection sold in the market is simply earphone making intermittent noises,which is quite annoying and inefficient. As such, there is a high demand for cheap and efficient driver sleep detection. Therefore, we came up with an idea to develop a driver anti-sleep alarm system, which could effectively meet this demand.

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect the sleepiness of the driver and make alarms accordingly. There will be a Kinect camera that constantlytakes image of driver, a beagle board that implement image processing algorithm, and a feedback circuit that could generate alarm and a power supply system.


These devices use various technologies to monitor the driver's condition and provide alerts or warnings when signs of drowsiness are detected. Here are some common types of driver anti-sleep devices:

Eye-Tracking Systems: These devices use cameras to monitor the driver's eye movements and detect signs of drowsiness or distraction. They can track parameters such as blink rate, eye closure duration, and head movements. When signs of drowsiness are detected, the system can issue alerts, such as visual or audible warnings, to alert the driver.

Steering Pattern Analysis: This type of device monitors the driver's steering behavior and analyzes patterns that indicate drowsiness or fatigue. It measures parameters like steering angle, stability, and the frequency of corrections made by the driver. If the system detects deviations from normal steering patterns, it can issue warnings to the driver.

Facial Expression Analysis: Some anti-sleep devices use cameras to analyze the driver's facial expressions and detect signs of drowsiness, such as drooping eyelids or yawning. They can also track changes in facial features, such as skin color or muscle activity, to assess the driver's level of fatigue.

Wearable Devices: There are wearable devices, such as smartwatches or headbands, that use sensors to monitor the driver's physiological signals, including heart rate, skin conductance, or brainwave activity. These devices can detect changes associated with drowsiness and send alerts to the driver.

In-Car Systems: Certain vehicle manufacturers have integrated drowsiness detection systems directly into their vehicles. These systems use a combination of sensors, including steering angle sensors, lane departure warning sensors, and accelerometers, to monitor the driver's behavior and issue warnings if signs of drowsiness are detected.
